Thanks for downloading this spidey-tools release!


To install the custom texture loader:
- Go to your Spider-Man installation
- Rename binkw32.dll to binkw32_.dll
- Copy the content of texture_loader/ into the directory



Other tools are Command Line Utilities so run then from Command Prompt or Powershell and inspect their output to learn more!
